                <li>Statistics is the science that, thanks also to methods and mathematics tools, deals with the information acquisition about a phenomenon and how these information are organized, analysed and interpreted.</li>

                        A <i>dataset</i> is a collection of descriptions of different instances of the same phenomenon. These descriptions could take a variety of forms, but it is important that they are descriptions of the same thing. For example, my grandfather collected the daily rainfall in his garder for many years; we could collect the height of each person in a room.<br />
                        &emsp;An <i>observation unit</i>, sometimes also called <i>statistical unit</i>, is the single inhabitans of the population over which is performed an observation. In other words, the unit of observation is the unit at or for which data is collected.
                        At the end, after choosing a phenomenon to observe, choosing observation units and collecting descriptions, we have a dataset.<br />

                        An <i>attribute</i> is a quality of an object (person, thing, etc.). As an example for a person, the possible attributes are: gender, age, sports etc. A <i>variable</i> is the set of all possible value that an attribute can take.

                            A very common way in which Statistics is used in Cybersecurity is to assess trends in order to take countermeasures. As an example, in the following link is showed how much UK organisations deal with Cybersecurity; the reasearch has been done by the UK government<br />

                            The purpose of the following paper is to describe the development of the cybersecurity datasets used to train the algorithms which are used for building IDS detection models, as well as analyzing and summarizing the different and famous Internet of things (IoT) attacks.<br />

                    In statistics, a <i>Distribution</i> is a representation of the way in which the different value of a variable (of an
                    attribute) are distributed in the statistical units of the statistical population.<br />
                    As an example let's consider an interview done in a cultural centre to establish the number of subscribers that speak a certain language. The following is the distribution gained from the interview:<br />
                    English:  118<br />
                    Italian: 200<br />
                    Spanish:  68
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        We define <i>Univariate distribution</i> of an attribute, the listing of the number of times each value of
                        the variable associated to the attribute appears.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A <i>Multivariate distribution</i> is a Univariate distribution on which the listing is performed over more than
                        one attribute.

                        A <i>Conditional distribution</i> is the distribution of an attribute to which is associated another attribute.
                        Alternatively, it is a simple distribution gained from a double distribution. Given a table in which we examine
                        simultaneously the variables of two attributes X and Y relatives to the same statistical population, we define
                        <i>Conditional distribution</i> each of the simple distributions of data expressed from a row or from a column
                        of the table itself.

                        Given a table that organize the values of two variable of two attribute. A <i>Marginal distribution</i> is
                        each of the simple distributions associated to only one attribute, regardless to the other. So, given
                        the conjoint distribution represented from the abovementioned table, we have two margianl distributions: one
                        for the row and for the column, expressed from the total of the rows and from the total of the columns; these
                        distributions are often reported at the margin of the table.

                    A comma-separated values (CSV) file is a text file that uses a <b>comma</b> to separate values. A CSV file
                    stores tabular data, such as numbers or text in a spreadsheet, in plain text. Each <i>line</i> of the file is a data
                    record. Each <i>record</i> consists of one or more fields, separated by commas. Thus, the file format gets its
                    name from using the comma to separate different values.
                    Example where each record is separated by a new line (<tt>CRLF</tt>):<br />
                    value1,value2,value3<tt>CRLF</tt><br />
                    value4,value5,value6<tt>CRLF</tt><br />
                    &emsp;There maybe an optional <i>header line</i> appearing as the first line of the file with the same format as
                    normal record lines. This header will contain names corresponding to the fields in the file and should contain
                    the same number of fields as the records in the rest of the file. Each field may or may not be enclosed in double
                    quotes.<br />
                    Example:<br />
                    "age","heigth"<tt>CRLF</tt><br />

                        Given a two-way frequency table, <i>conditional realtive frequency</i> is a fraction that tells you how many members of a
                        group have a particular characteristic. More technically, it is the ratio of a frequency in the center of the table to
                        the frequency’s row total or column total (and not the number that shows the total number of statistical unit tipically at
                        the bottom-right).<br />

                        the marginal relative frequency of girls who played the game is 15/33.

                        Given two events <tt>A</tt> and <tt>B</tt>, they are <i>statistical independent</i> if and only if event A occurring
                        confers no change to the probability of B, when compared to its unconditional probability.<br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The mathematical relationship with conditional relative frequency is that, since conditional relative frequency holds
                        when two non-independent event happen, the conditional realtive frequency is not independent.

                    <p>
                        For the other kinds of frequencies, the methematical relationship is simply the transportation to the fact that
                        a certain event occours. Taking the previous example, the probability to pick a girl who played the game is 45.5%
                        and the probability to pick a boy who missed the basket is 21.2%.

                    An <i>online algorithm</i> is an algorithm where inputs are arriving over time, and we need to make decisions on the fly
                    without knowing what will happen in the future. An offline algorithm, instead, requires all information BEFORE the algorithm start.<br />
                    &emsp;Selection sort is offline because step 1 is <tt>Find the minimum value in the list</tt>. To do this, you need to have the
                    entire list available - otherwise, how could you possibly know what the minimum value is? You cannot. Insertion sort, by contrast,
                    is online because it does not need to know anything about what values it will sort and the information is requested WHILE the algorithm
                    is running. Simply put, it can grab new values at every iteration.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The average is typical calculated doing: <tt>sum/#of_elements</tt>. Another way to calculate the average is by doing the following:<br />
                    <tt>previous_average + [(newer_number - previous_average) / #of_elements]</tt><br />
                    
                    &emsp;As an example, knowing that the average of two numbers is 7.5, if the average with the new number 3 has to be calculated, we can simply
                    do:<br />
                    <tt>7.5 + [(3 - 7.5) / 3] = 7.5 + [-4.5 / 3] = 6</tt>.<br />
                    
                    Because the average can be calculated when a new number is added, this algorithm is considered to be an online algorithm.<br />
                    
                    With this latter formula we have several advantages:
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>the accumulator which holds the sum of the numbers is not needed (hence we do not have to store a probably very big number)</li>
                        <li>avoid dealing with operataions that use a very big number like the probably one of the sum</li>
                    </ol>
                    For these reason it is very often used in information technology programs.
