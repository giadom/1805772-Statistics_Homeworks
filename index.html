                <li>Statistics is the science that, thanks also to methods and mathematics tools, deals with the information acquisition about a phenomenon and how these information are organized, analysed and interpreted.</li>

                        A <i>dataset</i> is a collection of descriptions of different instances of the same phenomenon. These descriptions could take a variety of forms, but it is important that they are descriptions of the same thing. For example, my grandfather collected the daily rainfall in his garder for many years; we could collect the height of each person in a room.<br />
                        &emsp;An <i>observation unit</i>, sometimes also called <i>statistical unit</i>, is the single inhabitans of the population over which is performed an observation. In other words, the unit of observation is the unit at or for which data is collected.
                        At the end, after choosing a phenomenon to observe, choosing observation units and collecting descriptions, we have a dataset.<br />

                    <p>
                        An <i>attribute</i> is a quality of an object (person, thing, etc.). As an example for a person, the possible attributes are: gender, age, sports etc. A <i>variable</i> is the set of all possible values that an attribute can take.

                            A very common way in which Statistics is used in Cybersecurity is to assess trends in order to take countermeasures. As an example, in the following link is showed how much UK organisations deal with Cybersecurity; the reasearch has been done by the UK government<br />

                            The purpose of the following paper is to describe the development of the cybersecurity datasets used to train the algorithms which are used for building IDS detection models, as well as analyzing and summarizing the different and famous Internet of things (IoT) attacks.<br />

                    In statistics, a <i>Distribution</i> is a representation of the way in which the different values of a variable (of an
                    attribute) are distributed in the statistical units of the statistical population.<br />
                    As an example let's consider an interview done in a cultural centre to establish the number of subscribers that speak a certain language. The following is the distribution gained from the interview:<br />
                    English:  118<br />
                    Italian: 200<br />
                    Spanish:  68

                    <p>
                        We define <i>Univariate distribution</i> of an attribute, the listing of the number of times each value of
                        the variable associated to the attribute appears.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A <i>Multivariate distribution</i> is a Univariate distribution on which the listing is performed over more than
                        one attribute.

                        A <i>Conditional distribution</i> is the distribution of an attribute to which is associated another attribute.
                        Alternatively, it is a simple distribution gained from a double distribution. Given a table in which we examine
                        simultaneously the variables of two attributes X and Y relatives to the same statistical population, we define
                        <i>Conditional distribution</i> each of the simple distributions of data expressed from a row or from a column
                        of the table itself.

                        Given a table that organize the values of two variable of two attribute. A <i>Marginal distribution</i> is
                        each of the simple distributions associated to only one attribute, regardless to the other. So, given
                        the conjoint distribution represented from the abovementioned table, we have two margianl distributions: one
                        for the row and for the column, expressed from the total of the rows and from the total of the columns; these
                        distributions are often reported at the margin of the table.

                    A comma-separated values (CSV) file is a text file that uses a <b>comma</b> to separate values. A CSV file
                    stores tabular data, such as numbers or text in a spreadsheet, in plain text. Each <i>line</i> of the file is a data
                    record. Each <i>record</i> consists of one or more fields, separated by commas. Thus, the file format gets its
                    name from using the comma to separate different values.
                    Example where each record is separated by a new line (<tt>CRLF</tt>):<br />
                    value1,value2,value3<tt>CRLF</tt><br />
                    value4,value5,value6<tt>CRLF</tt><br />
                    &emsp;There maybe an optional <i>header line</i> appearing as the first line of the file with the same format as
                    normal record lines. This header will contain names corresponding to the fields in the file and should contain
                    the same number of fields as the records in the rest of the file. Each field may or may not be enclosed in double
                    quotes.<br />
                    Example:<br />
                    "age","heigth"<tt>CRLF</tt><br />

                        Given a two-way frequency table, <i>conditional realtive frequency</i> is a fraction that tells you how many members of a
                        group have a particular characteristic. More technically, it is the ratio of a frequency in the center of the table to
                        the frequency’s row total or column total (and not the number that shows the total number of statistical unit tipically at

                        Given two events <tt>A</tt> and <tt>B</tt>, they are <i>statistical independent</i> if and only if event A occurring
                        confers no change to the probability of B, when compared to its unconditional probability.<br />

                    <p>
                        The mathematical relationship with conditional relative frequency is that, since conditional relative frequency holds
                        when two non-independent event happen, the conditional realtive frequency is not independent.

                        For the other kinds of frequencies, the methematical relationship is simply the transportation to the fact that
                        a certain event occours. Taking the previous example, the probability to pick a girl who played the game is 45.5%
                        and the probability to pick a boy who missed the basket is 21.2%.

                    An <i>online algorithm</i> is an algorithm where inputs are arriving over time, and we need to make decisions on the fly
                    without knowing what will happen in the future. An offline algorithm, instead, requires all information BEFORE the algorithm start.<br />
                    &emsp;Selection sort is offline because step 1 is <tt>Find the minimum value in the list</tt>. To do this, you need to have the
                    entire list available - otherwise, how could you possibly know what the minimum value is? You cannot. Insertion sort, by contrast,
                    is online because it does not need to know anything about what values it will sort and the information is requested WHILE the algorithm
                    is running. Simply put, it can grab new values at every iteration.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The average is typical calculated doing: <tt>sum/#of_elements</tt>. Another way to calculate the average is by doing the following:<br />
                    <tt>previous_average + [(newer_number - previous_average) / #of_elements]</tt><br />
                    
                    &emsp;As an example, knowing that the average of two numbers is 7.5, if the average with the new number 3 has to be calculated, we can simply
                    do:<br />
                    <tt>7.5 + [(3 - 7.5) / 3] = 7.5 + [-4.5 / 3] = 6</tt>.<br />
                    
                    Because the average can be calculated when a new number is added, this algorithm is considered to be an online algorithm.<br />
                    
                    With this latter formula we have several advantages:
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>the accumulator which holds the sum of the numbers is not needed (hence we do not have to store a probably very big number)</li>
                        <li>avoid dealing with operataions that use a very big number like the probably one of the sum</li>
                    </ol>
                    For these reason it is very often used in information technology programs.

                                For each disjoint event pair <i>E</i><sub>1</sub>,<i>E</i><sub>2</sub>,... (i.e.
                                such that <i>E</i><sub>i</sub>&cap;<i>E</i><sub>j</sub>=&empty; when i&ne;j), we have:<br />
                                Pr(&cup;<sup>&infin;</sup><sub>i=1</sub><i>E</i><sub>i</sub>)=&sum;<sup>&infin;</sup><sub>i=1</sub>Pr(<i>E</i><sub>i</sub>)

                        The Graphics Device Interface (GDI) is a component of Microsoft Windows responsible for representing graphical
                        objects and transmitting them to output devices such as monitors and printers. GDI+ is the enhancment of GDI.<br />
                        &emsp;Graphics objects are the heart of GDI+. They are represented by the Graphics class, which defines
                        methods and properties to draw and fill graphics objects.<br />
                        &emsp;We can divide Graphics class methods into three categories: draw, fill, and miscellaneous. Draw
                        methods are used to draw lines, curves etc.. Fill methods fill the interior area of graphics objects.
                        There are also a few miscellaneous methods that fall in neither category-for example, MeasureString and Clear.
                        <br /><br />
                        A Bitmap is an object used to work with images defined by pixel data.<br />
                        <tt>Public b As Bitmap</tt><br />
                        Before you can draw lines and shapes, render text or display and manipulate images with GDI+, you need to
                        create a Graphics object. The Graphics object represents a GDI+ drawing surface, and is the object that is
                        used to create graphical images.<br />
                        <tt>Public g As Graphics</tt><br />
                        Create a "Graphics" object from a Bitmap. Then use "Graphics"' methods to do what you need to the image
                        and then you can use the image how you need to. Your "Graphics" object is created to enable drawing on
                        another object.<br />
                        <tt>g = Graphics.FromImage(b)</tt>

                    <li>
                        To plot lines, graphics, etc. we have to transform a coordinate coming from the real World to a coordinate of
                        the virtual World (i.e. the World presented in computers). To do so we use two formulas: one for the abscissa
                        and one for the ordinate. In particular, for the y-axis we have to take into account that the origin starts
                        at the top left.<br />

                        In mathematics and statistics, the <i>arithmetic mean</i> or <i>arithmetic average</i>, or just the <i>mean</i> or the <i>average</i>
                        (when the context is clear), is the sum of a collection of numbers divided by the count of numbers in the collection.<br />

                                <i><b>Weighted mean</b></i>. A weighted average, or weighted mean, is an average in which some data points
                                count <b>more</b> heavily than others, in that they are given more weight in the calculation. There are two types
                                of weighted mean: (i) having the sum of the weights equal to one, (ii) not having the sum of the weights equal to one.

                                        In the first case, let's consider the arithmetic mean of 3 and 5 which is (3+5)/2=4, or, equivalently
                                        (1/2 * 3) + (1/2 * 5). In contrast, a weighted mean in which the first number receives, for example, twice as
                                        much weight as the second would be calculated as (2/3 * 3) + (1/2 * 5) = 11/3.
                                        Here the weights, which necessarily sum to the value one, are 2/3 and 1/3, the former being twice the latter.

                                        In the second case we simply give to the number a weight (i.e. multiply the number to the weight) and then
                                        summing all the numbers comeing from the multiplication. At the end we divide by the sum of the weight

                                This mean is useful when we would like to calculate the mean of multiplicative processes (like inflation, interests
                                of a money capital or growthing of a population).

                                <i><b>Variance</b></i>. Variance is an indicator of the variability of a set of data. A low value means that
                                the data is grouped very close together, while a high variance indicates more distributed data.<br />
                                The formule of the Variance is the following:<br />
                                s<sup>2</sup> = <sup>n</sup>&sum;<sub>i = 1</sub>[(x<sub>i</sub> - X)<sup>2</sup>] / n<br />
                                where:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>s<sup>2</sup> is the variance that is always measured in power unit;</li>
                                    <li>X that is the mean of the data of the sample;</li>
                                    <li>x<sub>i</sub> is a data of the sample.</li>
                                </ul>
                                Since the value gained is a power of the measure unit of data of the sample, we have to calculate the square root
                                of the Variance in order to gain a meaningful value. The result of the square root is named <i>Standard deviation</i>.
                                A useful property of the standard deviation is that, unlike the variance, it is expressed in the same unit as the data.

                        The <b>Weak law of large numbers</b> (or empirical law of chance) binds strictly the frequency to the classic probability.
                        It says: As the number of tests done increases, the frequency value tends to the theoretical value of probability.<br />
                        The difference with the standard mathematical convergence is that in the Probability convergence, attempts are required in
                        order to discover a convergence value, meanwhile in the standard one there is a known convergence value for each function
                        and hence is not required to perform attempts.

                        Statistical inference (or <b>Inferential statistics</b>) is the procedure by which the characteristics of a population are
                        induced by the observation of a part of it (called "sample"), usually selected by a random experiment.
                        Inferential statistics can be contrasted with descriptive statistics. Descriptive statistics is solely concerned
                        with properties of the observed data, and it does not rest on the assumption that the data come from a larger population.<br />
                        &emsp;The probabilty plays an important role in the Inferential statistics because it helps to infere (i.e. guess) results
                        on the rest of the population without actually conducting an expriment over it. In other words, given a sample, thanks to the
                        probability is possible to infer information about the theoretical population. In the Descriptive statistics, the probability
                        is used under the form of frequencies.

                        or things, a <i>statistical survey</i> is carried out. The set of elements, persons or things, on which a
                        statistical investigation is carried out is called a <i>statistical population</i>. A <i>sample</i> is
                        a subset of a population, i.e. it is just a part of the overall population.<br />
                        &emsp;<i>Statistic</i>: a numerical value calculated from a sample X<sub>1</sub>,...,X<sub>n</sub><br />
                        The value of a statistic varies from sample to sample. In other words, different samples will result
                        in different values of a statistic. Therefore, a statistic is a random variable with a distribution!<br />
                        &emsp;<i>Sampling distribution</i>: the distribution of statistic values from all possible samples of
                        size n. In other words, the <i>sampling distribution</i> of a statistic is a probability distribution
                        based on a large number of samples of size n from a given population.<br />
                        Brute force way to construct a sampling distribution:
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>take all possible samples of size n from the population;</li>
                            <li>compute the value of the statistic for each sample;</li>
                            <li>display the distribution of statistic values as a table, graph or equation.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Because the sample mean X<sup>-</sup> is a random variable, the sample mean itself has an expected value
                        and a variance, and thus has a probability distribution.<br /><br />
                        We need some new notation for the mean and variance of the distribution of sample means, simply
                        to differentiate from the mean and variance of the distribution of individual values. Denote
                        the mean of the distribution of sample means by &mu;<sub>X-</sub> and denote the variance of the
                        distribution of sample means by &sigma;<sup>2</sup><sub>X-</sub>.<br />
                        &emsp;It really doesn’t matter what the distribution of individual values looks like, if we make a
                        histogram of <b>many</b> sample means, the distribution will almost always be approximately normally distributed!<br />
                        This gives the following two results:
                        <ol type="1)">
                            <li>
                                the distribution of sample means seems to have the same center as the
                                distribution of individual values;
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                the variation in the distribution of sample means is much less than the original distribution.
                                (In other words, the distribution of sample means is much skinnier than the distribution of
                                individual values).
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        The first point tells us that the mean of the distribution of sample values, denoted &mu;<sub>X-</sub>,
                        is the same as the mean of the individual values, &mu;! Therefore, &mu;<sub>X-</sub> = &mu;<br />
                        In symbols:<br />
                        E[X-] = E[<sup>n</sup>&sum;<sub>i=1</sub>X<sub>i</sub> / n]<br />
                        = 1/n * <sup>n</sup>&sum;<sub>i=1</sub>E[X<sub>i</sub>]<br />
                        = 1/n * n * E[X]<br />
                        = E[X]<br />
                        =X-<br />
                        &emsp;What about the second point? The process of averaging takes many individual values that are spread out
                        and reduces them to one value, namely the sample mean X-<sub>i</sub>. All that variation in the individual values is
                        significantly reduced! Therefore, it should be obvious that &sigma;<sup>2</sup><sub>X-</sub> &lt;
                        &sigma;<sup>2</sup>.<br />
                        In symbols:<br />
                        &sigma;<sup>2</sup><sub>X-</sub> = Var(X-)<br />
                        = Var((<sup>n</sup>&sum;<sub>i=1</sub>X<sub>i</sub>) / n)<br />
                        = 1/n<sup>2</sup> * Var(<sup>n</sup>&sum;<sub>i=1</sub>X<sub>i</sub>)<br />
                        = 1/n<sup>2</sup> * n * Var(X)<br />
                        &asymp; &sigma;<sup>2</sup> / n-1<br />
                        So in conclusion we can say that the variance decreases as the sample size n increases.<br />
                        <br />
                        During sample analysis, the use of 'n-1' instead of 'n' in the denominator is called a Bessel correction.
                        The sample only represents an estimate of the complete population and the sample mean only partially fits this
                        estimate. The correction eliminates this inaccuracy.

                        Folland (1984) summarizes the difference between the Riemann and Lebesgue approaches thus:
                        "to compute the Riemann integral of <i>f</i>, one partitions the domain <i>[a, b]</i> into subintervals",
                        while in the Lebesgue integral, "one is in effect partitioning the range of <i>f</i>".<br /><br />
                        For the Riemann integral, the domain is partitioned into intervals, and bars are constructed to
                        meet the height of the graph. The areas of these bars are added together, and this approximates
                        the integral, in effect by summing areas of the form <i>f(x)dx</i>  where <i>f(x)</i> is the height of a
                        rectangle and <i>dx</i> is its width.<br /><br />
                        For the Lebesgue integral, the range is partitioned into intervals, and so the region under
                        the graph is partitioned into horizontal "slabs" (which may not be connected sets). The area
                        of a small horizontal "slab" under the graph of <i>f</i>, of height <i>dy</i>, is equal to the measure of the
                        slab's width times <i>dy</i>:<br />
                        &emsp;&mu;({<i>x</i>∣<i>f(x)</i> &gt; <i>y</i>})<i>dy</i>.<br />
                        The Lebesgue integral may then be defined by adding up the areas of these horizontal slabs.<br /><br />
                        You can use the Lebesgue integral to generalize the concept of the expected value to all kinds of functions;
                        Theory of Probability, in fact, deals a lot with Lebesgue integration. In all those cases where you
                        are not dealing with a probability distribution but rather an event that takes only a certain set of values,
                        you must use the following formula for the expected value:<br />
                        E[x]=&int;<i>X</i>d<i>P</i>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This proof uses the assumption of finite variance Var(X<sub>i</sub>)=&sigma;<sup>2</sup> (for all <i>i</i>).
                        The imdependence of the random variables imples no correlation between them, and we have that:<br />
                        &emsp;Var(X<sup>-</sup><sub>n</sub>) = Var( (1/n) * (X<sub>1</sub>+...+X<i>n</i>) ) =
                        (1/n<sup>2</sup>) * Var(X<sub>1</sub>+...+X<i>n</i>) = (n*&sigma;<sup>2</sup>)/n<sup>2</sup> =
                        &sigma;<sup>2</sup>/n.<br />
                        The common mean &mu; of the sequence is the mean of the sample average:<br />
                        &emsp;E[X<sup>-</sup><sub>n</sub>] = &mu;.<br />
                        Using Chebyshev's inequality on X<sup>-</sup><sub>n</sub> results in<br />
                        &emsp;P(|X<sup>-</sup><sub>n</sub>-&mu;|&ge;&epsilon;)&le;&sigma;<sup>2</sup>/(n*&epsilon;<sup>2</sup>).<br />
                        This may be used to obtain the following:<br />
                        &emsp;P(|X<sup>-</sup><sub>n</sub>-&mu;|&lt;&epsilon;) =
                        1-P(|X<sup>-</sup><sub>n</sub>-&mu;|&ge;&epsilon;) &ge; 1 - (&sigma;<sup>2</sup>/(n*&epsilon;<sup>2</sup>)).<br />
                        As n approaches infinity, the expression approches 1. And by definition of convergence in probability,
                        we have obtained<br />
                        &emsp;X<sup>-</sup><sub>n</sub> --&gt;<sup>P</sup> &mu; when n --&gt; &infin;
