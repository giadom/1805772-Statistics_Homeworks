                <li>Statistics is the science that, thanks also to methods and mathematics tools, deals with the information acquisition about a phenomenon and how these information are organized, analysed and interpreted.</li>

                        A <i>dataset</i> is a collection of descriptions of different instances of the same phenomenon. These descriptions could take a variety of forms, but it is important that they are descriptions of the same thing. For example, my grandfather collected the daily rainfall in his garder for many years; we could collect the height of each person in a room.<br />
                        &emsp;An <i>observation unit</i>, sometimes also called <i>statistical unit</i>, is the single inhabitans of the population over which is performed an observation. In other words, the unit of observation is the unit at or for which data is collected.
                        At the end, after choosing a phenomenon to observe, choosing observation units and collecting descriptions, we have a dataset.<br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An <i>attribute</i> is a quality of an object (person, thing, etc.). As an example for a person, the possible attributes are: gender, age, sports etc. A <i>variable</i> is the set of all possible value that an attribute can take.

                            A very common way in which Statistics is used in Cybersecurity is to assess trends in order to take countermeasures. As an example, in the following link is showed how much UK organisations deal with Cybersecurity; the reasearch has been done by the UK government<br />
                            <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/987652/CSBS_2021_business_trends_infographic.pdf">https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/987652/CSBS_2021_business_trends_infographic.pdf</a>

                            The purpose of the following paper is to describe the development of the cybersecurity datasets used to train the algorithms which are used for building IDS detection models, as well as analyzing and summarizing the different and famous Internet of things (IoT) attacks.<br />
                            <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anton-Konev-2/publication/358223470_The_Comparison_of_Cybersecurity_Datasets/links/61f6d421007fb50447260c47/The-Comparison-of-Cybersecurity-Datasets.pdf">https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anton-Konev-2/publication/358223470_The_Comparison_of_Cybersecurity_Datasets/links/61f6d421007fb50447260c47/The-Comparison-of-Cybersecurity-Datasets.pdf</a>

                         Another important way in which Statistics is used in Cybersecurity, is to discover if something dangerous is happening in our incoming network. The following paper illustrates a statistical analysis of network data.

                <ul>
                    <li>syntattical; e.g. C# requires the semicolon at the end of the instructions, meanwhile VB.NET does not;</li>
                    <li>the fact that VB.NET has an higher level of abstraction with respect of C#; e.g. in VB.NET the following declaration <tt>Dim i As Integer = "1"</tt> automatically converts a String to an Integer (those are two totally different types);</li>

                    In statistics, a <i>Distribution</i> is a representation of the way in which the different variables of an attribute are distributed in the statistical units of the statistical population.<br />
                    As an example let's consider an interview done in a cultural centre to establish the number of subscribers that speak a certain language. The following is the distribution gained from the interview:<br />
                    English:  118<br />
                    Italian: 200<br />

                    A comma-separated values (CSV) file is a text file that uses a <b>comma</b> to separate values. A CSV file
                    stores tabular data, such as numbers or text in a spreadsheet, in plain text. Each <i>line</i> of the file is a data
                    record. Each <i>record</i> consists of one or more fields, separated by commas. Thus, the file format gets its
                    name from using the comma to separate different values.
                    Example where each record is separated by a new line (<tt>CRLF</tt>):<br />
                    value1,value2,value3<tt>CRLF</tt><br />
                    value4,value5,value6<tt>CRLF</tt><br /><br />
                    &emsp;There maybe an optional <i>header line</i> appearing as the first line of the file with the same format as
                    normal record lines. This header will contain names corresponding to the fields in the file and should contain
                    the same number of fields as the records in the rest of the file. Each field may or may not be enclosed in double
                    quotes.<br />
                    Example:<br />
                    "age","heigth"<tt>CRLF</tt><br />
                    10,130<tt>CRLF</tt><br />
